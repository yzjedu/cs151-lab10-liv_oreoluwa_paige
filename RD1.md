The objective of this program was to analyze movie data from a CSV file by calculating profits, saving the updated data to a new file, 
and identifying the movie with the highest profit. This required file handling, data manipulation, and debugging to ensure accuracy and user-friendly output.

To solve the problem, I wrote functions to read and validate the input file, calculate profits, write the updated dataset to a new file, 
and identify the highest-profit movie. The program was tested with various inputs. It handled all scenarios correctly and produced the expected results.

Key concepts explored included file handling, list manipulation, and error handling. There were some challenges along the way. 
Initially, the program displayed the highest-profit movie multiple times due to redundant function calls, which I resolved by streamlining the program flow. 
Handling invalid file inputs also required implementing a loop to repeatedly prompt the user. Formatting large numbers for readability was another challenge, resolved by using Python’s string formatting tools. 
Debugging and testing was critical in overcoming these challenges.

I followed the first three rules of programming. I didn’t panic when issues arose, I treated incorrect outputs as errors and debugged systematically, 
and I tested the program with a wide variety of scenarios. These practices ensured a robust and reliable solution.

This project reinforced my understanding of file handling, data validation, and debugging, while also highlighting the importance of testing.
I believe I successfully met the learning objectives and improved my programming skills. Working with my partners was a positive experience—we collaborated on debugging and provided valuable feedback to each other. 
Overall, this project enhanced my problem-solving abilities and deepened my knowledge of Python programming.
