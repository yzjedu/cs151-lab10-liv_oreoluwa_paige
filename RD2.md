The purpose of this lab was to work with files and tables and continuing on practicing functions. We started by figuring
out what tasks we want the program to perform and then made those the functions. I find the most difficult part is using
what we learned in class and changing it in the right way to make it work for the assignment. At first when it wasn't
splitting up the file in the correct way I was really confused why. But after reading the readme again i realized that 
you can split based on commas instead of spaces and that solved one of the problems I was having. I enjoyed working with 
my group. We all helped each other when we had problems.
